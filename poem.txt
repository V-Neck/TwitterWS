A pixel on a timeline
Not even that our lifetimes 
even humanity as a whole 
hasnt reached that 
What about the edges of the timeline 
Whats there Both unknown 
even the edges of our pixel to an extent  
Whats to the left Our inexistence 
The pieces that make us
were there but we werent 
Where were we We were dead  
But we are alive now 
And we will die again 
Reborn into inexistence  
So we exist now 
Some say that 
What about to the right 
Will we exist again 
Some say that 
Well what about in the middle 
Thats right now and our job 
is to make sure right now 
happens for more people 
So thats where babies come from 
It sure is Goodnight
